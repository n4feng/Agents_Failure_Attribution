However, this method would require an API key.\\n\\nLet\\'s try setting up a simple alternative approach using a different data provider, like Alpha Vantage. Here\\'s how you can set it up:\\n\\n1. **Get an API Key**:\\n   - Visit [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) and sign up for a free API key.\\n\\n2. Once you have the key, replace `YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` in the code below with your actual API key.\\n\\nHere\\'s the code to fetch stock data from Alpha Vantage:\\n\\n```python\\n# filename: fetch_stock_alpha_vantage.py\\nimport requests\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\n# Alpha Vantage configuration\\nAPI_KEY = \\'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY\\'  # Replace with your actual API key\\nstocks = [\\'NVDA\\', \\'TSLA\\']\\nstart_date = \\'2023-01-01\\'\\nyear = 2023\\n\\n# Function to fetch stock data\\ndef fetch_stock_data(symbol):\\n    url = f\\'https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol={symbol}&apikey={API_KEY}&outputsize=full\\'\\n    response = requests.get(url)\\n    data = response.json()\\n    return data\\n\\n# Fetch data and process it\\nytd_change = {}\\nfor stock in stocks:\\n    data = fetch_stock_data(stock)\\n    time_series = data.get(\\'Time Series (Daily)\\', {})\\n    \\n    # Filter data for the specified year and save closing prices\\n    closing_prices = {}\\n    for date, values in time_series.items():\\n        if date.startswith(str(year)):\\n            closing_prices[date] = float(values[\\'4. close\\'])\\n\\n    # Calculate YTD change\\n    if closing_prices:\\n        first_price = closing_prices[list(closing_prices.keys())[-1]]\\n        last_price = closing_prices[list(closing_prices.keys())[0]]\\n        ytd_change[stock] = ((last_price - first_price) / first_price) * 100\\n\\n# Plotting results\\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\\npd.Series(ytd_change).plot(kind=\\'bar\\', color=[\\'blue\\', \\'orange\\'])\\nplt.title(\"YTD Price Change for NVDA and TSLA\")\\nplt.ylabel(\"Percentage Change (%)\")\\nplt.xticks(ticks=range(len(ytd_change)), labels=ytd_change.keys(), rotation=0)\\nplt.grid(axis=\\'y\\')\\nplt.tight_layout()\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\nPlease save this code to a new file called `fetch_stock_alpha_vantage.py` after replacing the placeholder with your actual Alpha Vantage API key, and execute it. This should provide YTD changes for NVDA and TSLA using the new data source.', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\\nCode output: \\nFigure(1000x500)\\n', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'It appears that the code executed successfully and created a figure representing the Year-to-Date price changes for NVDA and TSLA.

In most environments, running the script in a terminal will typically create the plot, but not display it. \\n\\nYou can modify the script to save the figure to a file so you can view it later.
