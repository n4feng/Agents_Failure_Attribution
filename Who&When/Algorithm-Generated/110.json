Let's gather this data through web search or any database available.\n\n## Step 2: Gather TripAdvisor Ratings and Reviews Data\nWe will now proceed to collect data from TripAdvisor for the listed hikes.\n\nTo achieve this, I'll write a script to gather the ratings and reviews data from TripAdvisor. Please note that web scraping from TripAdvisor directly without permission may violate their terms of service, so it's usually best to use their API if available.\n\nLet's start by checking if there's a TripAdvisor API we can utilize or else we will have to resort to web scraping methods.\n\n## Check for TripAdvisor API\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef check_tripadvisor_api():\n    api_endpoint = 'https://api.tripadvisor.com/api/partner/2.0/location/{location_id}/reviews'\n    headers = {\n        'X-TripAdvisor-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n    }\n    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nprint(check_tripadvisor_api())\n```\n\n## Step 3: Filter Hikes\nOnce we have gathered the TripAdvisor ratings and reviews data, we will filter out the hikes that do not meet our criteria of at least 4.5/5 average rating and at least 50 reviews.\n\n## Step 4: Validate Average Ratings and Number of Reviews\nFor each hike, we will calculate the average rating and ensure the number of reviews is at least 50.\n\n## Step 5: Select Final Hikes\nWe will list the final hikes that meet all the criteria:\n- Hike name\n- Average rating on TripAdvisor\n- Number of reviews on TripAdvisor",

Therefore, we might need to resort to web scraping or finding a reliable dataset that contains this information.\n\nWe can start by conducting a web search to gather detailed and relevant information about these hikes and their ratings on TripAdvisor.\n\nI'll proceed with a web search for TripAdvisor ratings and reviews of the following hikes in Yellowstone to gather the required data:\n1.
