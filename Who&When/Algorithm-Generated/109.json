            "content": "To verify the accuracy of the provided information about supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago that offer ready-to-eat salads for under $15, we'll follow the plan suggested by the manager. Let's begin by verifying each supermarket one-by-one.\n\n### 1. Verify the classification of Menards as a supermarket and its availability of ready-to-eat salads\n\nMenards is generally known as a home improvement store rather than a typical supermarket. To verify its classification and the availability of ready-to-eat salads, we need to consider the offerings typically associated with Menards. \n\n### 2. Confirm the prices and availability of ready-to-eat salads at Whole Foods Market and Costco\n\nWhole Foods Market and Costco are well-known supermarkets, and their locations and product availability can be verified through their respective websites or through customer service.\n\nLet's proceed step by step to confirm the details:\n\n#### Verification 1: Menards Classification and Offerings\n- Menards is not typically classified as a supermarket. It is primarily known as a home improvement store.\n- Availability of ready-to-eat salads: Menards does sell some grocery items, including ready-to-eat salads. We can verify this through Menards' online store or by checking in-store availability.\n\n#### Verification 2: Whole Foods Market\n- Whole Foods Market is well-known for offering a variety of fresh and prepared foods, including salads.\n- Prices: Whole Foods Market offers individual portions of salads typically around $10.99.\n\n#### Verification 3: Costco\n- Costco is known for its bulk offerings and has a variety of ready-to-eat salads.\n- Prices: Costco's salads are priced between $3.49 to $5.99 per pound. Additionally, the Udon-Noodle Salad with Dressing and Peanuts is available at $12.99 for 2 lbs.\n\n### Verification Plan using a Python Code Block\nWe will first verify the geographic proximity of these stores to Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n\n```python\nimport geopy.distance\n\ndef verify_geographic_proximity(store_address, reference_address=\"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL\"):\n    from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\n    geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"geo_verification\")\n    \n    location_reference = geolocator.geocode(reference_address)\n    location_store = geolocator.geocode(store_address)\n    \n    coords_reference = (location_reference.latitude, location_reference.longitude)\n    coords_store = (location_store.latitude, location_store.longitude)\n    \n    distance = geopy.distance.distance(coords_reference, coords_store).miles\n    \n    # Convert miles to blocks (assuming 20 blocks per mile)\n    distance_in_blocks = distance * 20\n    return distance_in_blocks\n\n# Addresses of the supermarkets\naddresses = {\n    \"Whole Foods Market\": \"1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago, IL 60642\",\n    \"Costco\": \"2746 N Clybourn Ave, Chicago, IL 60614\",\n    \"Menards\": \"2601 N Clybourn Ave, Chicago, IL 60614\"\n}\n\nproximities = {store: verify_geographic_proximity(address) for store, address in addresses.items()}\n\nfor store, blocks in proximities.items():\n    print(f\"{store} is approximately {blocks:.2f} blocks from Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL.\")\n```\n\nLet's run the verification code and interpret the results to confirm the proximity of these supermarkets to Lincoln Park.\n\nIf the proximities are confirmed to be within 2 blocks and the prices are accurately listed under $15, we can conclude that the information is accurate. If there are discrepancies, we will correct the information accordingly.",

As such, none of them qualify based on the proximity criterion set out in the task.\n\n#### Corrected List of Supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park:\nSince we need to meet the criteria of being within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park, Chicago, we need to identify alternative supermarkets that fit this criterion.\n\n### Plan for Identifying Correct Supermarkets:\n1.

Confirm the prices are under $15.\n\n#### Step 1: Identifying Supermarkets within 2 Blocks\nUsing a web search query or a local business directory service like Yelp or Google Maps would help us find supermarkets within close proximity to Lincoln Park.\n\nLet's perform a web search to gather this information.\n\n```python\nfrom functions import perform_web_search\n\nquery = \"supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park, Chicago\"\nresults = perform_web_search(query, count=10)\n\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nLet\u2019s execute this code to get the accurate list of supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park, Chicago.",
