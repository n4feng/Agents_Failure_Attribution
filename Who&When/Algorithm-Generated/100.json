Please solve the task carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US).\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The movie expert will identify all the movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n2. The data analyst will check the IMDB ratings and filter the movies based on the duration (less than 150 minutes).\n3. The streaming service expert will verify the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n4.
