In Apple's case, its Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the company's management, including setting strategic objectives and providing financial oversight. It is also tasked with significant responsibility, such as choosing CEOs and monitoring succession plans, providing guidance for acquisitions and disposing of assets, and ensuring that management maintains a focus on environmental and social performance.\n\nMoreover, the Apple Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that the company's operations align with its core values and ethical standards. This includes monitoring the company's compliance with laws and regulations, as well as ensuring that Apple's products and services are safe, reliable, and of high quality. The Board also plays a critical role in maintaining transparency and accountability, by regularly reporting to shareholders and the public on the company's performance and decision-making processes.\n\nHistory of the Apple Board of Directors\n\nApple's Board of Directors dates back to the company's founding in 1976. Initially, the board consisted of a few close colleagues of Steve Jobs, including Steve Wozniak and Mike Markkula. When Jobs left the company in 1985, he resigned from the Board of Directors. However, by the time he returned to the company in 1997, the board had evolved to include top industry luminaries like Bill Campbell, Ed Colligan, and Intuit founder Scott Cook. Today, Apple's Board of Directors is regarded as one of the most talented and diverse that exists.\n\nOver the years, the Apple Board of Directors has played a crucial role in the company's success. They have been responsible for making key decisions that have helped Apple become one of the most valuable companies in the world. For example, in 2007, the board approved the development of the iPhone, which revolutionized the smartphone industry and became one of Apple's most successful products.\n<Image>",
