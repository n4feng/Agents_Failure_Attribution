Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n    - The time period is May 2023.\n    - The focus is on the MBTA's Franklin-Foxboro line.\n    - The stops in question are between South Station and Windsor Gardens, not included.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n    - The specific names of the stops on the MBTA's Franklin-Foxboro line.\n    - The total number of stops on this line.\n    - The order of the stops on this line.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n    - The number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the Franklin-Foxboro line.\n    - Identify and count the stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens, not including these two stops themselves.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n    - Based on general knowledge, South Station is a major hub and probably an early stop on the Franklin-Foxboro line.\n    - Windsor Gardens is known to be comfortably west-southwest of Boston, suggesting several stops in between.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **WebSurfer:**\n    - Look up the current list of stops on the MBTA's Franklin-Foxboro line as of May 2023.\n    - Verify the order of these stops from South Station to Windsor Gardens.\n\n2. **Assistant:**\n    - Use the obtained information to count the number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens, excluding these two stops.\n    - Provide the final answer.\n\nBy following this plan, we can efficiently gather the necessary information and answer the original request.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
