Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is specifically asking for the link to a GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n- The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n- The species in question is beluga whales.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Determine where GFF3 files for beluga whales might be hosted; typically, such data might be found on genomic databases or specific research repositories.\n- Verify the location of the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n- Examples of potential sources include NCBI, Ensembl, or other genomic data repositories.\n- Look up whether any relevant research publications or database entries reference beluga whale GFF3 files around the specified date.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- None identified; the facts primarily need to be looked up in genomic databases and repositories.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- GFF3 files for biological species like beluga whales are likely maintained by major genomic data repositories such as NCBI or Ensembl.\n- The link may need to be sought within special sections or archives of these repositories, especially considering historical data as of 20/10/2020.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is the bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. Ask WebSurfer to search for the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n2. Instruct WebSurfer to focus on major genomic data repositories such as NCBI and Ensembl.\n3. Have WebSurfer navigate to the relevant pages and locate the file.\n4. Request WebSurfer to provide the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n5. Confirm the link with WebSurfer and ensure that it fits the criteria of being the most recent as of the specified date.\n\nLet's get started by asking WebSurfer to perform the initial search.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is specifically asking for the link to a GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n- The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n- The species in question is beluga whales.\n- Major repositories like NCBI and Ensembl are potential sources for genomic data files.\n- NCBI's Genome Data Browser and Ensembl's Genome Browser are tools to find specific genomic data files.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Determine the location of the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n- Check specific species pages or genome data sections on NCBI and Ensembl for available GFF3 files for beluga whales.\n- Look up any recent uploads related to beluga whale genomic data to these repositories around the specified date.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- None identified; the facts primarily need to be looked up in genomic databases and repositories.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- GFF3 files for biological species like beluga whales are likely maintained by major genomic data repositories such as NCBI or Ensembl.\n- The exact link to the GFF3 file may require navigating through species-specific pages or downloading sections of NCBI and Ensembl databases.\n- Genomic data for beluga whales might be included under specific BioProjects or assemblies, and searching these within NCBI or Ensembl could lead to the desired GFF3 files.\n- Historical data may be archived, and specific version tracking (like assembly versions) might need to be checked, especially for files up to the date 20/10/2020.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Approach:\n1. **NCBI Genome Data Browser**:\n    - Navigate to the NCBI Genome Data Browser.\n    - Search specifically for \"beluga whale\" or \"Delphinapterus leucas\" in the genomic data sections.\n    - Look for GFF3 files related to assemblies or BioProjects.\n\n2. **Ensembl Genome Browser**:\n    - Navigate to the Ensembl Genome Browser.\n    - Search for \"beluga whale\" or \"Delphinapterus leucas\".\n    - Locate genome data files (GFF3) in the species-specific section.\n\n### Instructions for WebSurfer:\nPlease:\n1. **NCBI Genome Data Browser**:\n    - Go to the NCBI Genome Data Browser (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/).\n    - Use the search bar to enter \"beluga whale\" or \"Delphinapterus leucas\".\n    - Find the genomic data files, focusing on GFF3 files available up to 20/10/2020.\n    - Provide the direct link to the GFF3 file if located.\n\n2. **Ensembl Genome Browser**:\n    - Go to the Ensembl Genome Browser (https://www.ensembl.org/index.html).\n    - Search for \"beluga whale\" or \"Delphinapterus leucas\".\n    - Locate genome data files (GFF3) in the species-specific section up to 20/10/2020.\n    - Provide the direct link to the GFF3 file if found.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n- The previous attempts focused on navigating and searching NCBI or Ensembl genome browsers but encountered difficulties identifying and accessing specific GFF3 files directly through the search interfaces.\n- Despite navigating relevant sections, no direct links to GFF3 files for beluga whales were found, leading to dead ends or irrelevant search results.\n\n### New Plan to Overcome Challenges\n1. **Focused Search on Specific Sections**\n   - Instead of broad searches, target specific sections within NCBI and Ensembl that are most likely to host GFF3 files, such as FTP directories or dedicated genome project pages.\n\n2. **Use Direct Queries**\n   - Use specific queries related to \"beluga whale GFF3 file\" along with assembly names or project IDs to narrow down the search.\n\n3. **FileSurfer Exploration**\n   - If the direct online search fails, involve FileSurfer to check any locally available archives or data repositories.\n\n### Bullet-Point Plan\n1. **NCBI Genome Data Browser**\n   - Navigate directly to the FTP sections commonly used for file downloads.\n   - Use targeted search terms: \"beluga whale GFF3 file 20/10/2020” on NCBI datasets.\n   - Check the results for assembly-specific pages for corresponding GFF3 files.\n   - Extract the direct link if located.\n   \n2. **Ensembl Genome Browser**\n   - Navigate to Ensembl FTP site (ftp.ensembl.org) for downloadable files.\n   - Search directories specific to mammalian genomic data.\n   - Use the search bar to enter \"beluga whale GFF3 file 20/10/2020” directly in FTP site.\n   - Extract the direct link if located.\n\n3. **Search for Repository References**\n   - Look for README or documentation files within the directories that might list available GFF3 files for beluga whales.\n\n### Instructions for WebSurfer\n1. **NCBI Genome Data Browser**\n   - Access NCBI Genome FTP site (ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).\n   - Navigate to the `genomes/` directory or equivalent, and find the beluga whale directory.\n   - Search for GFF3 files in this directory, noting the latest file available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n2. **Ensembl Genome Browser**\n   - Access the Ensembl FTP site (ftp.ensembl.org).\n   - Navigate to the `pub/`, and inside, look for entries related to mammalian datasets.\n   - Find the specific directory for beluga whale data.\n   - Look for available GFF3 files, noting the latest one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **Using Online Documentation**\n   - Search for online documentation that may reference specific GFF3 files for beluga whales within scholarly articles or genetic research papers.\n\n### Instructions for FileSurfer (if needed)\n  - Explore any local archives or previously downloaded datasets of genomic data for beluga whales.\n  - Identify any GFF3 files available and ensure they are up to the specified date, 20/10/2020.",
