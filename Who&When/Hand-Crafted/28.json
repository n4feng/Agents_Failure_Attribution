Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The query focuses on the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n- The requester needs information on a bar close to this museum that is wheelchair accessible.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The exact location of the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n- Bars located near the Mummers Museum.\n- Accessibility information for these bars.\n- Review sources or directories that list accessibility features of Philadelphia bars (e.g., Yelp, Google Maps, Accessibility websites).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The distance between the Mummers Museum and the nearby bars to determine the closest one.\n- Verification that the closest bar is wheelchair accessible, based on available facilities.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Center City Philadelphia has various bars, some of which are likely to be wheelchair accessible given the city's size and the current trend toward inclusive design in establishments.\n\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere's a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **Identify Location of Mummers Museum:**\n   - WebSurfer will search for the exact address of the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n\n2. **Find Nearby Bars:**\n   - WebSurfer will use a mapping service (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp) to list bars in close proximity to the Mummers Museum address.\n\n3. **Check Wheelchair Accessibility:**\n   - WebSurfer will check for accessibility details of each nearby bar using reviews and accessibility information on the same platforms (Google Maps, Yelp).\n\n4. **Determine Closest Accessible Bar:**\n   - Analyze the distances between the Mummers Museum and the nearby bars to identify the closest one that is confirmed to be wheelchair accessible.\n\nLet’s start by asking WebSurfer to find the exact address of the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
