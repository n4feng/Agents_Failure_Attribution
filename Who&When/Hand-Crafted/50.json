Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- Location: Within 1 block of Washington Square Park\n- Type: Restaurants (not takeaway only)\n- Menu: Vegan mains\n- Price: Under $15\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Specific names and addresses of restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park\n- Vegan menu items offered by these restaurants and their prices\n- Whether these restaurants are dine-in (not takeaway only)\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The distance from Washington Square Park to a given restaurant to confirm it is within 1 block\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Types of cuisines that are more likely to offer vegan mains under $15 (e.g., casual cafes, certain ethnic cuisines like Middle Eastern or Asian)\n- Common price ranges for vegan dishes in the vicinity of Washington Square Park based on typical dining costs in New York City.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **Identify Restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park:**\n   - Ask WebSurfer to search for a list of restaurants located within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n\n2. **Filter for Dine-in Only Restaurants:**\n   - From the list of restaurants, determine which ones offer dine-in service and are not takeaway only.\n\n3. **Identify Vegan Mains and Prices:**\n   - For the filtered restaurants, check their menus to identify vegan main dishes and verify that these dishes are priced under $15.\n\n4. **Compile and Present the Findings:**\n   - Compile the list of restaurants that meet all the criteria and present the findings.\n\nLet's get started with step 1 by asking WebSurfer to find restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

            "content": "New plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich restaurants (not takeaway only) within 1 blocks of Washington Square Park have vegan mains for under $15?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nSure, here’s an updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- Location: Within 1 block of Washington Square Park\n- Type: Restaurants (not takeaway only)\n- Menu: Vegan mains\n- Price: Under $15\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Specific names and addresses of restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park\n- Vegan menu items offered by these restaurants and their prices\n- Whether these restaurants are dine-in (not takeaway only)\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The distance from Washington Square Park to a given restaurant to confirm it is within 1 block\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Based on the preliminary searches, mainstream and higher-end restaurants (e.g., Italian, French-Vietnamese) are unlikely to offer vegan mains for under $15. Therefore, it’s more practical to look at casual or ethnic cuisine places (such as Middle Eastern, Indian, or Asian cafes).**\n- Common price ranges for vegan dishes in the vicinity of Washington Square Park based on typical dining costs in New York City.\n- Restaurants like cafes and bistros are more likely to have accessible pricing, and might offer vegan mains under $15.\n\nExplanation:\nFrom the research, it's clear that places such as Palma and Knickerbocker Bar & Grill have more upscale pricing, making it less likely they offer vegan meals for under $15. Thus, redirecting focus to casual dining options that are more likely to fit the budget and dietary requirements. This new strategy improves targeting accuracy for the given request.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Explanation of What Went Wrong\nThe primary issue in the previous runs was spending too much time on higher-end restaurants that are unlikely to offer vegan mains under $15, instead of focusing on casual or ethnic establishments that are more likely to have affordable options.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Identify Target Restaurants:**\n   - Focus on identifying casual or ethnic cuisine restaurants (e.g., Middle Eastern, Indian, Asian) within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n\n2. **Filter Dine-In Restaurants:**\n   - Ensure the identified restaurants offer dine-in services and are not takeaway only.\n\n3. **Check Menus for Prices:**\n   - Check the menus of the identified restaurants for vegan main dishes and ensure their prices are under $15.\n\n4. **Compile and Present Findings:**\n   - Compile the list of qualifying restaurants with their vegan main offerings and prices.\n\n### Steps\n1. **Step 1: Identify Casual and Ethnic Restaurants:**\n   - [WebSurfer] Conduct a search specifically for casual or ethnic cuisine restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n\n2. **Step 2: Confirm Dine-In Services:**\n   - [WebSurfer] Check if these restaurants offer dine-in services via their official websites or review sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor.\n\n3. **Step 3: Check Menu Prices:**\n   - [WebSurfer] Access the menus of these restaurants and confirm if vegan main dishes are available for under $15. Note down the prices.\n\n4. **Step 4: Present Findings:**\n   - [Assistant] Compile the findings into a summary of restaurants that meet all criteria and present them. \n\nBy focusing searches on casual and ethnic cuisine restaurants likely to meet the budget and dietary requirements, this plan aims to effectively gather the necessary information.",
