What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n- The dog genome has been updated several times since 2004.\n- The request is for the link to the files most relevant in May 2020.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Specific updates made to the dog genome mapping up to May 2020.\n- Locations or databases where the updated dog genome files might be stored (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl, UCSC Genome Browser).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determining which specific file or version of the dog genome was considered most relevant or widely used as of May 2020 based on available updates.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- It is likely that major genome databases such as NCBI, Ensembl, or UCSC Genome Browser would have hosted the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n- The relevant genome file might be either the most recent update before May 2020 or the one most cited in literature around that time.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **Start with WebSurfer:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for the most relevant version of the dog genome files as of May 2020.\n   - Focus on major genome databases like NCBI, Ensembl, and UCSC Genome Browser.\n\n2. **Identify Specific Genome Versions:**\n   - Look for information on the specific version number or name of the dog genome that was updated closest to May 2020.\n   - Check for release notes or update logs on these databases for confirmation.\n\n3. **Retrieve Links:**\n   - Once the relevant version is identified, find the direct links to the files on the identified genome database sites.\n\n4. **Provide Links:**\n   - Collect and present the links to the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\nBy following this plan, we can efficiently address the request with a focus on accuracy and reliability. Let's start with WebSurfer to gather necessary information from the major genome databases.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
