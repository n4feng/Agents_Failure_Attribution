Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves finding the date when the Regression label was added to an issue in the numpy.polynomial GitHub repository.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The GitHub repository for NumPy, particularly the numpy.polynomial section.\n- The list of issues in the numpy.polynomial section that have the 'Regression' label.\n- The date when the 'Regression' label was added to the oldest closed issue with this label.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determine the oldest closed issue in the numpy.polynomial section with the 'Regression' label by looking at the dates of various issues.\n- Determine the specific MM/DD/YY date when the Regression label was applied to this issue.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The Regression label was added at some point after the creation of the numpy.polynomial GitHub issues section. The exact date will need to be found by searching through the issues listed under this label.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is the plan to address the original request:\n\n1. **Access the GitHub Page**:\n    - WebSurfer should navigate to the NumPy GitHub repository, specifically to the \"Issues\" section.\n\n2. **Search for Issues with 'Regression' Label**:\n    - WebSurfer should filter the issues by the 'Regression' label and sort by oldest to see the closed issues.\n\n3. **Identify the Oldest Closed Issue**:\n    - WebSurfer should identify the oldest closed issue that has the 'Regression' label.\n\n4. **Find the Date the Label was Added**:\n    - WebSurfer should check the issue details and comment log to find the date when the 'Regression' label was added to this issue.\n\n5. **Note the Date in MM/DD/YY Format**:\n    - WebSurfer should provide the discovered date in the requested MM/DD/YY format.\n\n**Involved Agent**: WebSurfer\n**Reason**: This task primarily involves navigating through the GitHub interface, searching and sorting issues, and checking time-stamped comments or logs, which can be efficiently handled by WebSurfer. \n\nOnce the WebSurfer has these details, we can conclude the task efficiently.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nSure, here\u2019s the updated fact sheet incorporating what we have learned so far:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves finding the date when the Regression label was added to an issue in the numpy.polynomial GitHub repository.\n- The NumPy GitHub repository is located at https://github.com/numpy/numpy.\n- The Issues section of the NumPy GitHub repository can be accessed at https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific issues within the numpy.polynomial submodule that have the 'Regression' label.\n- The exact date when the 'Regression' label was added to the oldest closed issue with this label in that submodule.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determine the oldest closed issue in the numpy.polynomial section with the 'Regression' label by looking at the dates of various issues.\n- Determine the specific MM/DD/YY date when the Regression label was applied to this issue.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Searching for the 'Regression' label in the entire NumPy repository issues may provide the list of issues across all submodules, including numpy.polynomial.\n- Given the high number of issues (2k open and 11k closed), sorting and filtering by label 'Regression' and manually checking the oldest issues might be necessary.\n- It's likely that the Regression label's addition timestamp can be found in the issue's activity or event logs on GitHub.\n\nBy focusing on filtering label 'Regression' and identifying the oldest closed issue, we can methodically determine when the label was added.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure:\nThe previous attempts focused on navigating to the NumPy GitHub repository and Issues section, but did not successfully filter the issues specifically by the 'Regression' label or fully navigate to find the oldest closed issue with the 'Regression' label. This resulted in repeated navigation steps without achieving the actual data extraction needed.\n\n### New Plan to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n\n1. **Navigate to GitHub Repository**:\n   - WebSurfer should open the NumPy GitHub repository at https://github.com/numpy/numpy.\n\n2. **Access the Issues Section**:\n   - WebSurfer should go directly to the Issues section by clicking on the \u2018Issues\u2019 tab.\n\n3. **Filter by Regression Label**:\n   - WebSurfer should use the label filter to search for issues labeled 'Regression' (use the label:Regression filter in the search bar).\n\n4. **Sort and Identify Oldest Closed Issue**:\n   - WebSurfer should sort the filtered issues to display the oldest closed issues first.\n   - WebSurfer should identify the oldest closed issue with the 'Regression' label.\n\n5. **Check Issue Details**:\n   - WebSurfer should open the oldest closed issue identified and check its activity or event log to find when the 'Regression' label was added to the issue.\n\n6. **Provide the Date in MM/DD/YY Format**:\n   - WebSurfer should note the exact date when the Regression label was added and provide this date in MM/DD/YY format.\n\nBy strictly following these steps to filter and sort the issues correctly, and directly checking the details of the oldest closed issue with the Regression label, we can avoid repeating the same mistakes and efficiently find the required date.",

Here\u2019s how you can proceed:\n\n1. **Access the GitHub API to Retrieve Issues Data:**\n   - The GitHub API can be used to fetch issues data from a repository.\n   - You can filter issues by labels and states using query parameters.\n   - You can retrieve the full JSON output for analysis.\n\n2. **Filter Issues for numpy.polynomial with Regression Label:**\n   - After fetching the issues data, you can filter it for issues related to the numpy.polynomial module which have the 'Regression' label.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Use GitHub REST API to Retrieve Issues:**\n   - The endpoint for fetching issues in a repository is:\n     ```\n     https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/issues\n     ```\n   - For the NumPy repository, it would be:\n     ```\n     https://api.github.com/repos/numpy/numpy/issues\n     ```\n   - You can use query parameters to filter by label and state. For example, to get issues with the 'Regression' label, you can use:\n     ```\n     https://api.github.com/repos/numpy/numpy/issues?labels=Regression&state=all\n     ```\n\n2. **Analyze JSON Data:**\n   - Once you retrieve the JSON data, you can parse it to find issues related to the numpy.polynomial module.\n   - Check the `title` and `body` fields of the issues for any mentions of `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n### Example Code to Retrieve and Parse Issues:\n\nHere\u2019s an example using Python to get issues from the GitHub API, filter by label and state, and search mentions of `numpy.polynomial` in the issue fields:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Endpoint to get issues with Regression label\nurl = 'https://api.github.com/repos/numpy/numpy/issues'\nparams = {\n    'labels': 'Regression',\n    'state': 'all',\n    'per_page': 100  # Number of issues per page\n}\n\n# Get the issues from the GitHub API\nresponse = requests.get(url, params=params, headers={'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'})\n\n# Check if request was successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    issues = response.json()\n\n    # Filter issues that mention numpy.polynomial\n    filtered_issues = [issue for issue in issues if 'numpy.polynomial' in issue.get('title', '') or 'numpy.polynomial' in issue.get('body', '')]\n\n    # Output filtered issue details\n    for issue in filtered_issues:\n        print(f\"Issue Title: {issue['title']}\")\n        print(f\"Created At: {issue['created_at']}\")\n        print(f\"Body: {issue.get('body', 'No body')}\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Failed to retrieve issues. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n\n```\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Run the above script to fetch and filter issues.\n- Analyze the results to determine the oldest closed issue with the Regression label related to numpy.polynomial.\n- Write a summary of findings.\n\nLet me know if you need any specific help in setting up or running the script!",

            "content": "New plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere\u2019s the updated fact sheet incorporating what we have learned so far:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves finding the date when the Regression label was added to an issue in the numpy.polynomial GitHub repository.\n- The NumPy GitHub repository is located at https://github.com/numpy/numpy.\n- The Issues section of the NumPy GitHub repository can be accessed at https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.\n- The specific label that includes 'Regression' in its name is '06 - Regression'.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific issues within the numpy.polynomial submodule that have the '06 - Regression' label.\n- The exact date when the '06 - Regression' label was added to the oldest closed issue with this label in that submodule.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determine the oldest closed issue in the numpy.polynomial section with the '06 - Regression' label by looking at the dates of various issues.\n- Determine the specific MM/DD/YY date when the '06 - Regression' label was applied to this issue.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Searching for the '06 - Regression' label in the entire NumPy repository issues may provide the list of issues across all submodules, including numpy.polynomial.\n- Given the high number of issues (2k open and 11k closed), sorting and filtering by label '06 - Regression' and manually checking the oldest issues might be necessary.\n- It's likely that the Regression label's addition timestamp can be found in the issue's activity or event logs on GitHub.\n- There might be variations or different expressions of the Regression label (like '06 - Regression', 'Bug-Regression'), so it's essential to ensure we capture the correct label used in the repository.\n\nBy focusing on filtering the '06 - Regression' label and identifying the oldest closed issue, we can methodically determine when the label was added.\n\nNext, let\u2019s use the identified label '06 - Regression' to search for related issues mentioning `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n### Updated Python Script:\n\nTo incorporate this new label, let's update our search:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef fetch_issues_with_label(owner, repo, label, per_page=100):\n    issues = []\n    page = 1\n\n    while True:\n        url = f'https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues'\n        params = {\n            'labels': label,\n            'state': 'all',\n            'per_page': per_page,\n            'page': page  # Number of issues per page\n        }\n\n        response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers={'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'})\n        \n        if response.status_code != 200:\n            print(f\"Failed to retrieve issues. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n            break\n\n        page_issues = response.json()\n        if not page_issues:\n            break\n\n        issues.extend(page_issues)\n        page += 1\n    \n    return issues\n\ndef filter_issues_by_keyword(issues, keyword):\n    filtered_issues = [\n        issue for issue in issues if keyword in issue.get('title', '') or keyword in issue.get('body', '')\n    ]\n    return filtered_issues\n\ndef main():\n    owner = 'numpy'\n    repo = 'numpy'\n    label = '06 - Regression'\n    keyword = 'numpy.polynomial'\n\n    issues = fetch_issues_with_label(owner, repo, label)\n\n    if issues:\n        filtered_issues = filter_issues_by_keyword(issues, keyword)\n        if filtered_issues:\n            oldest_issue = min(filtered_issues, key=lambda x: x['created_at'])\n            print(f\"Oldest Issue Title: {oldest_issue['title']}\")\n            print(f\"Created At: {oldest_issue['created_at']}\")\n            print(f\"Body: {oldest_issue.get('body', 'No body')}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"No issues found mentioning numpy.polynomial.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No issues found with the specified label.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nPlease proceed to run this updated script to find the relevant issues.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n1. The initial searches using the 'Regression' label yielded no results because the label was initially misidentified.\n2. The label \u201806 - Regression\u2019 was identified later, but the second fetch and search for issues using this label didn\u2019t yield results related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n### New Plan to Overcome Prior Challenges\n1. **Label Identification (Clarification)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the exact naming patterns and usage of '06 - Regression' in the GitHub repository and any variations that might exist.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Search**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform searches not only with the label '06 - Regression' but also explore issues without this label containing `Regression` in their description/title.\n\n3. **Update Script Check with Detailed Output**:\n   - Fine-tune the script to ensure it clearly checks the labeling and provides more informative and detailed feedback about which issues it processes and any potential skips.\n   - Use more verbose logging to understand the flow better.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Verify Labels and Variants**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the '06 - Regression' label and any other potential variants (if any) are cross-checked.\n\n2. **Python Script Update (with Detailed Debugging)**:\n   - **Assistant**: Update the script to print each issue's title and body content as it processes them to validate the correct search flow.\n\n```python\n# filename: fetch_issues_verbose.py\nimport requests\n\ndef fetch_issues_with_label(owner, repo, label, per_page=100):\n    issues = []\n    page = 1\n\n    while True:\n        url = f'https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues'\n        params = {\n            'labels': label,\n            'state': 'all',\n            'per_page': per_page,\n            'page': page # Number of issues per page\n        }\n\n        response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers={'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'})\n        \n        if response.status_code != 200:\n            print(f\"Failed to retrieve issues. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n            break\n\n        page_issues = response.json()\n        if not page_issues:\n            break\n\n        issues.extend(page_issues)\n        page += 1\n    \n    return issues\n\ndef filter_issues_by_keyword(issues, keyword):\n    filtered_issues = [\n        issue for issue in issues if keyword in issue.get('title', '').lower() or keyword in issue.get('body', '').lower()\n    ]\n    return filtered_issues\n\ndef main():\n    owner = 'numpy'\n    repo = 'numpy'\n    label = '06 - Regression'\n    keyword = 'numpy.polynomial'\n\n    print(f\"Fetching issues with label: {label}\")\n    issues = fetch_issues_with_label(owner, repo, label)\n    \n    if issues:\n        print(f\"Total issues fetched: {len(issues)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No issues found with the specified label.\")\n        return\n    \n    print(f\"Filtering for issues mentioning {keyword}\")\n    filtered_issues = filter_issues_by_keyword(issues, keyword)\n    \n    for issue in filtered_issues:\n        print(f\"Checking Issue: {issue['title']}\")\n        print(f\"Body Content: {issue.get('body', 'No body')}\")\n    \n    if filtered_issues:\n        oldest_issue = min(filtered_issues, key=lambda x: x['created_at'])\n        print(f\"Oldest Issue Title: {oldest_issue['title']}\")\n        print(f\"Created At: {oldest_issue['created_at']}\")\n        print(f\"Body: {oldest_issue.get('body', 'No body')}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No issues found mentioning numpy.polynomial.\")\n    \n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n3. **Run the Updated Script**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Execute `fetch_issues_verbose.py` to ensure detailed logging and check for issues.\n\n4. **Cross-check Results and Validate**:\n   - Analyze results for accurate identification.\n   - Identify the date when the '06 - Regression' label was added to the oldest closed issue that mentions `numpy.polynomial`.\n\nBy following these steps, we can narrow down the issue identification process and avoid missing potential cases or scenarios.",
