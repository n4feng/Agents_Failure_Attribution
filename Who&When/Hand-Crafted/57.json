            "content": "Initial plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Magic: The Gathering Standard card (non-foil paper version released in its original set) that was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns) had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- Oko, Thief of Crowns was banned.\n- Oko, Thief of Crowns was banned in its Standard format.\n- We're looking for a non-foil paper version of a card.\n- We're comparing the card's all-time high price to its all-time low price.\n- The card must have been banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n\n### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific date Oko, Thief of Crowns was banned in Standard.\n- Which cards were banned alongside Oko, Thief of Crowns in Standard.\n- All-time high and all-time low prices for the cards banned alongside Oko, Thief of Crowns. This information can be found on price-tracking websites like MTGGoldfish, TCGPlayer, or other Magic: The Gathering card price databases.\n\n### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The exact price decrease (difference) for each card from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n- The card with the highest price decrease based on collected price data.\n\n### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The cards banned alongside Oko, Thief of Crowns might include other powerful or overused cards from the same period/set.\n- Likely candidates might be those from sets such as \"Throne of Eldraine\" (the set Oko was from) because cards from powerhouse sets often see high fluctuations in price, especially after a banning.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Plan to Address the Original Request\n\n1. **Identify the Date of the Ban:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to find the exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns was banned in Standard format.\n\n2. **Identify Other Cards Banned Simultaneously:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to find the list of other Magic: The Gathering cards that were banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n\n3. **Obtain Price Data for Each Card:**\n   - For each card banned simultaneously with Oko, Thief of Crowns, use WebSurfer to look up the all-time high and all-time low prices of the non-foil paper version of those cards on price-tracking websites such as MTGGoldfish or TCGPlayer.\n\n4. **Calculate the Price Decrease:**\n   - Use Assistant to tabulate and compute the price decrease for each card.\n\n5. **Determine the Card with the Highest Price Decrease:**\n   - Compare the price decreases and identify the card with the highest drop from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n\n6. **Report the Findings:**\n   - Summarize and report the card that had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n\n### Team Member Tasks\n\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Find the ban date for Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n  - Identify other cards banned at the same time.\n  - Obtain all-time high and all-time low price data for each banned card.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Tabulate the obtained price data and compute the price decrease for each card.\n  - Compile the final findings into a summary report.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
