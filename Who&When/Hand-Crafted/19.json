Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- Fubo's IPO happened in a specific year.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The year Fubo went public (Fubo's IPO date/year).\n- Names and joining dates of the members of Fubo's Management Team.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Cross-referencing the IPO year with the joining dates of Fubo's Management Team members to identify who joined in the same year as the IPO.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Given that IPOs are significant events, it is plausible that key management team members joined either just before or just after the IPO to steer the company through such a momentous occasion.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Determine the Year of Fubo's IPO**\n  - **Assign to WebSurfer**: Look up the year Fubo went public.\n\n- **Identify Members of Fubo's Management Team and Their Joining Dates**\n  - **Assign to WebSurfer**: Search for the names and joining dates of the current or past management team members of Fubo.\n\n- **Cross-reference IPO Year with Joining Dates**\n  - **Assign to Assistant**: Match the management team members' joining dates with the IPO year to identify which members joined in the same year as the IPO. \n\nIf necessary:\n- **Verify Results by Cross-Referencing Multiple Sources**\n  - **Assign to WebSurfer**: Verify the joining dates through additional credible sources if there are discrepancies.\n\nLet's start with the first step.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

The network focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports. Depending on the country it is accessed in, channels offered by Fubo include access to the Premier League, NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS, CPL, and international football, as well as news, network television series, and movies.[2]\n\nLaunched on January 1, 2015, as a soccer streaming service, Fubo changed to an all-sports service in 2017 and then to a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) model.[3] As a vMVPD, Fubo still markets itself as a sports-first service, but it has since expanded its programming to include channels that fall under other genres, including ones with reality shows, premium movies and cable news.\n\nAs of 2018, Fubo was available in Canada, Spain and the United States.[4] In the U.S., there are several service options with different channel lineups, including a base package of over 100 linear content channels, which also include free content streams that are found on competing services. A number of add-on packages are also available for viewers who want more programming options, Spanish-language content, premium movie networks or additional features.[5]\n\nAs of November 2024, the company says it has 1.991 million global paying subscribers, including 1.613 million subscribers in North America.[6]\n\nFuboTV Inc.\n\nCurrent logo used since March 21, 2023\nCompany type\t\t\t\tPublic\nTraded as\t\t\t\tNYSE: FUBO\nIndustry\t\t\t\tPay television\nFounded\t\t\t\tJanuary 1, 2015; 9 years ago\nFounder\t\t\t\tDavid Gandler\n                                         Alberto Horihuela\n                                         Sung Ho Choi\nHeadquarters\t\t\t\t1330 Avenue of the Americas\n                                          New York, NY 10019\n                                          U.S.\nArea served\t\t\t                Canada\n                        \t\t\t        Spain\n                        \t\t\t        United States\nKey people\t\t\t\tDavid Gandler (CEO)\n                                          Albert Horihuela (head of marketing)\n                         \t\t          Edgar Bronfman Jr. (chairman)\nServices\t\t\t\tStreaming television\nRevenue\t\t\t\tUS$1.37 Billion (2023)[1]\nOperating income\t\t\t−US$375.5 million\n\n\nHistory edit\n\n\nContents\thide\n\nTop\n History\n Early years\n 2020\n 2021\n 2022–2023\n 2024\n Features\n Ratings\n Fubo Sports Network\n Supported devices\n TV-connected\n Mobile\n Computer\n References\n External links\n\nAppearance\thide\nText\n Small\t\t\n Standard\t\t\n Large\t\t\n\nWidth\n Standard\t\t\n Wide\t\t\n\nColor (beta)\n Automatic\t\t\n Light\t\t\n Dark\n<Image>",

According to the article, fuboTV plans to leverage Facebank's IP portfolio to create new streaming experiences for consumers and also expand internationally. FaceBank is traded on the OTC exchange and, following the merger, Gandler noted the company plans to uplist to a major stock exchange.[20] Following its merger with FaceBank Group, FuboTV began trading on the OTC under the ticker symbol FUBO.\n\nIn the months following the merger, John Textor resigned his post as Executive Chairman, and the company named former Warner Music Group Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr. as Executive Chairman of the Board. Other directors, such as early Spotify investor Par-Jorgen Parson and venture capitalist Daniel Leff were also named to the Board. All three were early investors in FuboTV.[21]\n\nIn June 2020, FuboTV announced a long-awaited deal with Disney Media Networks to being ESPN Inc., and Walt Disney Television (including ESPN and its networks and ABC, along with children's networks such as Disney Channel) to the sports-focused streaming service sometime in the summer. The deal was to make FuboTV a \"force in sports streaming,\" according to Fortune.[22] It would go live on August 1.[23] On July 1, 2020, FuboTV dropped WarnerMedia networks, including CNN, TBS and TNT.[24]\n\nOn September 15, 2020, FuboTV said it expected to close 2020 with 410,000–420,000 subscribers as a result of the return of sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company also announced it was approved to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) \"conditional upon successful pricing of this offering, under the ticker symbol FUBO.\"[25]\n\nOn October 7, 2020, fuboTV completed its initial public offering as a New York Stock Exchange company, raising roughly $183 million in proceeds.[26] FuboTV began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \"FUBO\" on October 8, 2020, as fuboTV shares jumped 10% higher in their market debut.[27]\n\nAppearance hide\n\nText\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\n\nWidth\nStandard\nWide\n\nColor (beta)\nAutomatic\nLight\nDark\n<Image>",

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- Fubo's IPO happened in 2020.\n- Fubo began trading on the NYSE on October 8, 2020.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Names and joining dates of the members of Fubo's Management Team.\n- Specific press releases or official announcements from Fubo regarding management hires in 2020.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Cross-referencing the IPO year (2020) with the joining dates of Fubo's Management Team members to identify who joined in the same year as the IPO.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Given that IPOs are significant events, it is plausible that key management team members joined either just before or just after the IPO to steer the company through such a momentous occasion.\n- Management changes are often announced in quarterly or annual reports, which are typically released on official company websites or financial news platforms.\n- It is likely that press releases from 2020 will detail any new hires or changes in the management team, given the importance of the IPO year.\n\nExplanation of Educated Guess:\nWe added an educated guess that management changes are often announced in official company reports and press releases. This is based on standard corporate communication practices, especially during significant events like an IPO, where transparency about leadership is crucial for investor confidence.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure:\nThe primary failure stemmed from not efficiently gathering specific information about Fubo's management team hires in 2020. The process was further delayed by not effectively navigating the year-specific press releases and announcements on Fubo's official website to find the necessary data.\n\n### New Plan to Overcome Challenges:\n1. **Review Fubo's Management Team Page:**\n   - **Assign to WebSurfer:** Go directly to the FuboTV management team page if available (often found in the \"About\" or \"Team\" section of the official site).\n\n2. **Access and Review Press Releases:**\n   - **Assign to WebSurfer:** Navigate to the Press Release section on Fubo's website and filter to the year 2020. Specifically look for announcements related to new management hires or significant personnel changes.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference Information:**\n   - **Assistant Role:** Cross-reference the management team members' names and their joining dates with online profiles (such as LinkedIn) to ensure data accuracy. \n\n4. **Use Reliable Business News Sources:**\n   - **Assign to WebSurfer:** Utilize trusted financial news websites and business analysis platforms, such as Bloomberg, Reuters, or MarketWatch, for any articles or news that discuss FuboTV's management hires in 2020.\n\n### Steps to Implement the New Plan:\n1. **Access Fubo's Management Team Page:**\n   - Visit the official FuboTV site and locate the \"About Us\" or \"Management Team\" section.\n2. **Review Year-Specific Press Releases:**\n   - Filter the news and press release sections on FuboTV's official site to the year 2020. Identify key announcements related to new hires.\n3. **Cross-Reference with Public Profiles:**\n   - Use LinkedIn to find profiles of Fubo's management team members and confirm their joining dates.\n4. **Verify via Business News:**\n   - Search for FuboTV management hires in 2020 on reputable business news websites to confirm and gather any additional insights.\n\nBy systematically gathering and verifying data from multiple reliable sources, we will efficiently identify which members of Fubo's management team joined during the IPO year.",
