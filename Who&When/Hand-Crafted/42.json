Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The source of information is the Cornell Law School website's legal information institute.\n- The information concerns the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n- The query relates to the first rule in a specific article containing \"witnesses\" in most titles as of 2021.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The federal rules on the Cornell Law School legal information institute website.\n- The fifth section of federal rules sorted alphabetically.\n- The first rule in the relevant article that includes \"witnesses\" in most titles.\n- The details of the last amendment made to this rule.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determining which section qualifies as the fifth when federal rules are ordered alphabetically.\n- Identifying the specific article with \"witnesses\" in most titles.\n- Determining the exact word(s) deleted from the first rule in this article.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Federal rules likely include categories such as Rules of Evidence, Criminal Procedure, Civil Procedure, and Appellate Procedure.\n- The section with \"witnesses\" in the title could be related to one of these categories, possibly the Rules of Evidence.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a plan to address the original request:\n\n1. **Use WebSurfer to Access Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute's Website:**\n   - Navigate to the Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute's website.\n   - Identify the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Article:**\n   - Within the identified section, search for the article with \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021.\n\n3. **Determine the First Rule and its Amendments:**\n   - Find the first rule within that article.\n   - Check the details of the last amendment made to this rule.\n   - Identify the word that was deleted in the last amendment.\n\nBy following these steps, we can efficiently extract the required information. \n\nLet's proceed with these steps using WebSurfer.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

Competency to Testify in General\nEvery person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness\u2019s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision.\n\nNotes\n(Pub. L. 93\u2013595, \u00a71, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)\n\nNotes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules\n\n    This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds.\n\n    The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501.\n\n    No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore \u00a7\u00a7501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty.
